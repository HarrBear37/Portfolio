2a. I used the close open method to the <sp>'s. I found lines in between paragraphs using \n\n
2b. I replaced what I found with \n</sp>\n<sp>\n
3a.I cop and pasted everything into an XML doc and did some cleaning. I had to add an element around everything and an <sp> at the beginning of the first paragrapth. I also had to do this with the at the last paragraph but with a </sp>.
