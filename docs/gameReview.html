            <p>Mobility is a game on Itch.io made by Auroiax, Tom Hermans, and released on February 17th 2018. He had some help from his brother in level making and all the audio was made by Luke Steinman. He has said it was developed in his game design class.</p>
            <p>Mobility is a precision platformer taking place in space. Tom knew how difficult this genre can be so, this is his take on making it more accessible to beginners. But this game can still be enjoyed by seasoned players with the option to change the difficulty.</p>

            <h1>The Game</h1>
            <hr/>
            <p>In Mobility, you play as the Mobilitist. After going through a little tutorial, you receive the task to play help fix the engines on the ships. The ships are powered by the levels you play. Once you beat a certain amount of levels, the ships power will come back online.</p>
            <p>The levels require you to hit every platform. Each level has four ways to play it. Those being Radius, Contact, Vanish, and Growth. Radius give each platform a circle around it. The player only has to enter the circle to change the platfoms color. Contact has the plater touch each platform. Vanish will make the platform that the player has touched disappear. Growth is similar to Vanish. In it, the platforms will become electric after being touched. If the plater touches them then they will have to start from the beginning of the level. </p>

            <h1>The Characters</h1>
            <hr/>
            <p>At the beginning of the game, you play as the Mobilitist. He is a square. There is no much to his design. </p>
            <p>After playing all the levels on Arrowhead, you player the character, Scarf Cat. Scarf Cat lives up to his name by being a cat with a scarf. After a level, Scarf Cat will put his scarf above his head in celebration.</p>
            <p>After playing all the levels on Starii, the player will unlock the character, Ninja. Ninja is a ninja. Mind blowing I know. After a level, Ninja will jump in the air in celebration.</p>
            <p>After playing all the levels on Meteore, the player will unlock the character, Toastar. Toastar is a piece of toast with a little smile on it. After a level, Toastar will pop out of toaster.</p>
            <p>After playing all the levels on StarFixHQ, the player will unlock the character, The CEO. The CEO a square like the Mobilitist but has a suit. After a level, the CEO will have his mech come down and get him.</p>
            <p>Each character plays the same. The only differences are visual. I like this. It doesn't put any pressure on the player to play the best one. It is up to personal preference.</p>

            <h2>The NPC's</h2>
            <hr/>
            <p>The NPC's are all around each ship. They are easy to talk to. All the player has to do is press the down arrow key or S. The NPC's are around the say something funny or to guide the player in the right direction.</p>

            <h1>Options & Extras</h1>
            <hr/>
            <p>There are a lot of option for the plater to choose from. All of the are very useful. Some are obvious like volume, language, and controls.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>But there are some that are very nice. You can change the background colors of the game or font or being able to slowdown the game. It think that all of these setting are great.</p>

            <p>Some of the extra content in the game is to make your own levels. I think this is great! Tom has continued to update this game since July of this year. The level editor is actually a new feature!</p>

            <h1>Closing</h1>
            <hr/>
            <p>In closing, I really like this game. I can see myself playing it after this porject. I have always love platformers like Mario. So, I was able to pick up a lot of the mechanics quickly. Each level has a timer and it is fun to try and beat your time. It is fun to come up with new strategies to beat the level just a bit faster.</p>
            <p>I can see this game become more and more popular. I am also willing to see the developers other games.</p>
